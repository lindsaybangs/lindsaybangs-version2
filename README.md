# Lindsay Bangs v2
The second version of my personal site, using Bootstrap.
Work in Progress.

## TODO
+ This TODO
+ Finish filling in content
  + About Me
  + Projects
  + Archive
+ Add Archive into navigation somehow
+ Change up the fonts
+ Work on Accessibility

## Why?
In order to gain more experience and understand the way websites, web applications and web development works; 
I am building a personal website for myself with different technologies for each version.

## Version 2
For my second go at making a website, I chose to take advantage of Bootstrap and make a more modern, but still simple,
website with a focus on being mobile-friendly.  Accessibility will be added into this site once design is complete.  
Version control is another technology that I am familiarizing myself with during this project.

Content-wise, I added a Projects page and an Archive page.

## Tools
+ VIM
+ Google Chrome
+ Git/Github
+ Adobe Dreamweaver to quickly generate templates
