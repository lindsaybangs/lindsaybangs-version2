<h1> About </h1>
    <p class="lead"> In short, I am a student seeking internship and co-op opportunities for the next four to twelve months. </p>
        
    <p class="text-center text-muted"><i class="fa fa-coffee"></i></p>
        
    <p> Currently I am working for the Goverment of Canada as an Interaction Designer.  What I like about my job is that I 
    	can work on user interfaces for real web applications that will be used by Canadians.  I was also able to design an 
        internal application out of user requirements by myself.  That and I get to learn technology that is new to me, and 
        work as part of a team on large applications that have been around for a while. </p>
        
    <p class="text-center text-muted"><i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></i></p>
        
    <p> Most of the time I am a student at Carleton University, where I study Computer Science with a specialization in Mobile 
    	Computing.  I'm interested in Human Computer Interaction, because I find the way people interact with computers to be
        unpredictable and exciting.  I want to make intuitive user interfaces that are easy to use. I also have a minor in 
        Greek and Roman Studies.  Computer Science and Classics don't seem to go together (they didn't have
        computers in antiquity, did they?) but I found myself taking many of my electives in courses like Classical Mythology. </p>

    <p class="text-center text-muted"><i class="fa fa-home"></i></p>

    <p> In my spare time, I find myself reading books out in the sunshine.  I enjoy craft beer, though I can't explain in succinct words
    	why I like certain beers and not others.  Sometimes I pretend to be an artist and splash acrylic paint around on a canvas, but 
        usually it just ends up being a mess.  Other times I pretend to be a musician, and I practice playing the flute fairly regularly
        so it's not as much of a stretch. I am also an accomplished daydreamer.</p>
